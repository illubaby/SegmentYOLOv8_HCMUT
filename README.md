# SegmentYOLOv8: Semantic and Instance Segmentation using YOLOv8

## Introduction
SegmentYOLOv8 is an advanced machine learning project that leverages the power of YOLOv8 for semantic and instance segmentation tasks. This project aims to combine the high-speed object detection capabilities of YOLOv8 with precise segmentation techniques to deliver state-of-the-art performance in segmenting images into meaningful parts and instances.

## Features
- **YOLOv8 Integration**: Utilizes the latest iteration of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, YOLOv8, known for its speed and accuracy in object detection.
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Capable of classifying every pixel in an image to a corresponding class, providing a comprehensive understanding of the scene.
- **Instance Segmentation**: Goes beyond semantic segmentation by differentiating between individual objects of the same class.
- **Real-time Performance**: Optimized for real-time applications, making it suitable for video processing, autonomous vehicles, and other time-sensitive uses.
- **Robust Dataset Handling**: Supports various datasets and can be easily adapted for custom datasets.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning Framework**: Implemented using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), based on user preference.
- **Programming Language**: Primarily written in Python, leveraging libraries such as NumPy and OpenCV for image processing.
